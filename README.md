# Potly

A major part of every data workflow involves doing Exploratory Data Analysis.

Being able to extract information from data and presenting it in some meaningful and effective way is perhaps the most important Data Science skill.

# Python has many charting libraries. Some of them present static graphs like those from Matplotlib and Seaborn. While some present us with interactive or dynamic graphs like those in the case of Plotly, Bokeh and Altair.

# Dynamic vs Static
Let me be honest . Static graphs look dull to me. Being able to provide other the ability to click around the plot, look at each data point closely gives them the opportunity to extract the maximum information out of the graph. You are no longer bounded by the constraints of a static plot.

In the world of Dynamic plotting in Python, Plotly has a name of its own. It is perhaps the most widely used interactive graphing library used. Plus with the inclusion on plotly express, it has become extremely simple to create stunning graphs as well.

So, without much ado, lets start with learning how to use Plotly Express to create graphs!

# Graphs I am planning to include in the tutorial
# Scatter Plots
# Line Charts
# Bar Charts
# Pie Charts
# Histogram
# Box Plot
# Violin Plot
